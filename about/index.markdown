<p>Enjoy my little home on the web. It is where you can be sure to find my rants and raves about nothing and everything.</p>
<p>My meager little background is basically this...</p>
<p>I am a Network Engineer, holding the following certifications: MCSE (NT4&#47;2000&#47;2003), MCSA (2000&#47;2003), CCNA, CCEA, ACA on Implementation.</p>
<p>After many years in the field, I moved around in the ranks of Network Engineer, Systems Administrator, Systems Engineer, Application Engineer and finally to my current position and duties as a Solutions Architect. Dabbling in the dark arts of programming has helped me to mold into a Swiss Army Knife of skills, with a full adoption of the DevOps guiding principles.</p>
