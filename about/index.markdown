Enjoy my little home on the web. It is where you can be sure to find my rants and raves about nothing and everything.
My meager little background is basically this...

* I am a Network Engineer, holding the following certifications: 
  * MCSE (NT4, 2000, 2003) 
      
  * MCSA (2000, 2003)
      
  * CCNA
      
  * CCEA 
      
  * ACA on Implementation
      
After many years in the field, I moved around in the ranks of Network Engineer, Systems Administrator, Systems Engineer, Application Engineer and finally to my current position and duties as a Solutions Architect. Dabbling in the dark arts of programming has helped me to mold into a Swiss Army Knife of skills, with a full adoption of the DevOps guiding principles.
