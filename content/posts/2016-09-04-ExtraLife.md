title: Extra Life 2016
---

I have for a couple years now participated in Extra Life in order to raise money for kids. This year is no different. I hope that if you have time to read this, you might also find
it in your heart to give to the cause. I feel it's important to do what we can to support and help those around us, especially children who are not always in a position to help themselves.
