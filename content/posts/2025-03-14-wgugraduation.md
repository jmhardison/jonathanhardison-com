title: Life goal completed, BSCS achieved.
---


Life takes directions on its own, leading you down paths that may not always align to where you thought you would end up. In my case, while I have a lot of eduction accumulated, I had never completed my degree. I could probably look back and find other chances to have picked up the torch and ran with it, but it doesn't really matter. What truely matters is that I did finally complete it, and can officially tick that item off the life goal list.

As of March 2025, I have completed a `Bachelors of Science, Computer Science` degree at WGU. This happened to also be their new degree program that included a focus on AI/ML. I haven't yet published any of the projects I worked on, mostly due to the request that you not do so as a student. So for now, I'll just note that my project focused on a model that was built for sentiment analasys of gaming product reviews, usable through an API. But that's a wagtail for now, huzzah I'm done with a degree.
