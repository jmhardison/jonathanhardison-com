<p>Being an avid game player, as a way to pass my time while I'm not working or studying, I'm<br />
always on the look out for the next great game. Playing everything from free MMO's to pay MMO's<br />
and even beta's that die before release (Wish, hint hint). I just had to post something about this.</p>
<p>Age of Conan is shaping up to be a defining standard for what is to be expected of an MMO in the<br />
future. And here I though LOTRO was the greatest visual experience running it in DX10 mode.<br />
Well, take a look at this video and see for yourself. Maybe you too will want to become an Age of Conan<br />
Preorder like me!</p>
<p>The interesting aspect of this game, is up to level 20 you are solo. You play online, but in a solo instance.<br />
This is to get your training out of the way without just throwing you into the fray. Of course they could have<br />
done the "tutorial" thing like all other games, but instead they wanted to give you a story tailored to you.<br />
After level 20 it's the big bad world for you!</p>
