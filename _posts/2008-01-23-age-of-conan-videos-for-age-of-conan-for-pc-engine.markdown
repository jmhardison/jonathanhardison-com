Being an avid game player, as a way to pass my time while I’m not working or studying, I’m
 always on the look out for the next great game. Playing everything from free MMO’s to pay MMO’s
 and even beta’s that die before release (Wish, hint hint). I just had to post something about this.

Age of Conan is shaping up to be a defining standard for what is to be expected of an MMO in the
 future. And here I though LOTRO was the greatest visual experience running it in DX10 mode.
 Well, take a look at this video and see for yourself. Maybe you too will want to become an Age of Conan
 Preorder like me!

The interesting aspect of this game, is up to level 20 you are solo. You play online, but in a solo instance.
 This is to get your training out of the way without just throwing you into the fray. Of course they could have
 done the “tutorial” thing like all other games, but instead they wanted to give you a story tailored to you.
 After level 20 it’s the big bad world for you!
