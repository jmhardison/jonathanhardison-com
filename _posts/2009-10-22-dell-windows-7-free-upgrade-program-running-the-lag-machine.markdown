<p>Time to go complete your Dell Windows 7 Free Upgrade order! Since Windows 7 has officially launched, the Dell upgrade site is most likely inundated with requests. I managed to complete my order and receive a confirmation email of the order. But it took a good 15 minutes to make it through the four page site.   <br &#47;><&#47;p>
<p>So to add to the misery of Dell, EVERYONE needs to go order their Windows 7 kit. If you registered your system that came with a free upgrade, now is the time, go go go!<&#47;p></p>
