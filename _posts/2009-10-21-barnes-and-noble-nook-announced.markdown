<p>This device is also the first to be released using Google&rsquo;s Android as the OS. Which also brings to question how long it will take for someone to modify the unit. Or will someone even need to? From the sounds of it, B&amp;N seems a little open to the idea of Android Apps being available for use. Regardless however, this unit shows great potential and serious threat to the Kindle. The specs for the unit are impressive, as well as a few key notes. One is that the unit allows you to lend your books to other users of the software or devices. Two, you can sync between the nook or any other device running the B&amp;N eReader. And finally, the nook can tap into the Google Books project, for access to over 500,000 free books and other publications.<&#47;p>
<p>   <br &#47;>    <br &#47;>Now if you were sitting around yesterday for the revealing of this un<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.jonathanhardison.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2009&#47;10&#47;nook_frontview.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="nook_front view" border="0" alt="nook_front view" align="right" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.jonathanhardison.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2009&#47;10&#47;nook_frontview_thumb.jpg" width="301" height="401" &#47;><&#47;a>it, you may have noticed that it was available for preorder online before they announced it. Probably a mistake, but that didn&rsquo;t stop me from placing my preorder and then watching the site get pulled until they were ready ready.<&#47;p>
<p>Head on over and view the system specs, and place your preorder if you feel so inclined. Or if you wish to wait for some of the other devices coming, you can do that as well.<&#47;p>
