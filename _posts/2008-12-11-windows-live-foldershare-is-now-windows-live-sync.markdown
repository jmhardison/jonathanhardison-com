<p>Microsoft finally released the new version of FolderShare, which is now under the name Windows Live Sync.</p>
<p>There are a lot of improvements to this version, one important feature is the use of your Passport&#47;Windows Live ID. No more having a separate ID for this nifty little program.</p>
<p>Some of the updates from their blog include:</p>
<li>Higher file limits&mdash;up to 20 synchronized folders (formerly known as libraries) with up to 20,000 files in each one.<&#47;li>
<li>Integration with Windows Live ID.<&#47;li>
<li>Integration with the Recycle Bin.<&#47;li>
<li>Unicode support.<&#47;li>
<li>More languages for Windows (46 in all).<&#47;li>
<li>And lots of bug fixes.<&#47;li><br />
Having ran the FolderShare client for a while now, it has become a valuable tool that I use to keep my business and personal data copied between my work laptop and home systems. Very handy for when I'm traveling and make document changes or additional files, as it will start sending those to my home system automatically.</p>
