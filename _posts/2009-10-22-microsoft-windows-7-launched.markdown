<p>The next version of Microsoft's desktop operating system has officially launched!<br />
<img class="size-full wp-image-298 alignleft" title="hero_3-boxes" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.jonathanhardison.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2009&#47;10&#47;hero_3-boxes.gif" alt="hero_3-boxes" width="296" height="105" &#47;>Windows 7 has been out for a couple months on MSDN<br />
or those with Software Assurance, and now it has officially launched.<br />
I have been using it since release on MSDN, and I can honestly say it<br />
is a solid OS that was worth the wait. Of course there are the normal<br />
issues, such as when you upgrade the stability is reduced and you<br />
may wind up with more problems, as well as the IT community being<br />
hesitant to deploy for reasons that are theirs alone. But the latter will diminish in time as they see it really is a great<br />
OS that should carry with it great potential for the future. Because lets face it, why stay on XP? Why limit yourself to XP?<br />
Why would someone who is to be in the front lines of IT say they refuse change, and want to stay with an antiquated<br />
product? Instead of solving problems, and making things work, they would rather stay with something they have<br />
already solved the problems for? That's just being lazy, and you should walk away with your feet and stand there<br />
with your shirt.</p>
<p>For everyone else who enjoys the latest greatest, and what the horizons bring... enjoy the latest release of Windows.</p>
<p>And try to ignore the anti machine from Apple, they have many faults themselves, and just because you are upgrading<br />
to Windows 7, doesn't mean it is a good time to do a forklift upgrade to Mac. (Forklift would involve you scrapping<br />
all software and finding alternatives on the mac, unless you want to buy a mac just to go back and boot camp into<br />
Windows, which would be absolutely pointless and a waste of money.)</p>
<p>Here are some features of Windows 7.</p>
<p>One tip though for everyone... the SHOW DESKTOP has been replaced by a little square in the bottom right of<br />
your task bar. That's right, all the way over there on the right side of the clock... press it, it's ok.</p>
