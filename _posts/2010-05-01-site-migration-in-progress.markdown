<p>I have began the wonderful process of migrating my site from being hosted at GoDaddy to JustHost.com. What's my reasoning? First, cheaper... and second faster! That's right, two that should not go together.</p>
<p>Either way, I will update when it's complete. For now just take note that this is the first post on the new site.</p>
<p>Update 5&#47;2&#47;2010:<br />
So I have finished moving my site, but not DNS yet. I'm testing that on my alternate domain.<br />
As of now I have mirated my WordPress site from an IIS host to Linux(Cpanel).</p>
<p>Everything appears to be up and operational, and I have began looking at name server migration.<br />
The new host, JustHost.com, appears to be much &nbsp;quicker than GoDaddy. That performance increase is very&nbsp;noticeable&nbsp;in CPanel as well as the admin portion of WordPress.</p>
<p>Update 5&#47;10&#47;2010:</p>
<p>DNS migration has been completed. There is an hour delay in creating sub domains at JustHost.com, but that is not an unacceptable time. So from my experiences so far the host is very reliable. Couple that with the 3 tickets I've had closed for cname and a record creations, their support has proven very responsive and talented.</p>
<p>I've added their ad to the sidebar, if anyone wants to jump on their services, it's worth the jump. Especially if you are moving from GoDaddy, king of slothville.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update 3&#47;10&#47;2014:</p>
<p>The time has come to move off just host.com, their service had continually degraded over time and the ease at which your site could be disabled due to excessive use was easy. So I've moved over to NameCheap.com for now, we shall see how they do.</p>
