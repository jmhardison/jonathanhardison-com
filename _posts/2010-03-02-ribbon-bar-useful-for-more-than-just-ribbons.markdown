Working with the Ribbon Bar (Fluent) in a rebuild of an app I wrote, I am toying with it being more than simply the control doc for buttons and such above a single form. I'm expanding it to be the doc for user input floating above independent grids displaying content for the current tab item in the ribbon. Why? BECAUSE I CAN! Buwaa aa aa aaaaa.
