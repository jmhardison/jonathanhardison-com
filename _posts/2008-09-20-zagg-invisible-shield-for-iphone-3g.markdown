I just ordered the invisible Shield for my iPhone. As soon as it arrives I will be sure to post the findings on it’s ease of install and usefulness.

I just love how thin the iPhone is, and hate the idea of putting a case on it to make it larger. I also don’t like the thin rubber wraps, as I have one for my Treo 800w and it drags my pocket lining out all the time.

This product is also said to provide the user a better grip, so I’ll be sure to see how it treats my pocket lining.
