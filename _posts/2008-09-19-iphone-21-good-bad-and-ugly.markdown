Ever have that feeling that things should just work? Well, for the most part the iPhone does just work. And works well. But there are a few items that seem to be basic things that should just work.

  * No Copy and Paste - Never had it, still waiting for it.

  * No MMS - Apparently third party apps like Twitter can do it, but itâ€™s not built in.

  * Cannot delete single call from history

  * Does not show call details for old calls, only fairly recent calls. (History such as call duration.)

  * PUSH exchange has intermittent issues on 2.1 where it will fail to update.

  * VPN will not automatically connect, you must press ON.

  * Cannot change email alert tone, sent message tone, and several others.

  * No native HOTMAIL support. Must purchase hotmail plus and run a pop connection.


Of course this phone has enough to offset these issues for a short time, so I will remain happy for now.
