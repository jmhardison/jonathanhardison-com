![Prepare To Drool]({{site.base}}/imagecontent/2008/10/simcity-081009.gif)
Complete and total SimCity'ness on your iPhone. Prepare to drool.

SCHWEET is the word I can think of to describe this upcoming title.

Who hasn’t wasted endless hours of their life playing SimCity, and if you haven’t and are in IT then SHAME on you! You must pay your dues, go … build me a city fit for a king and let it be destroyed by rampant tornadoes and earthquakes.
