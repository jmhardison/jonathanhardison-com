For those who have a Shell Gas Station close by, you may or may not have noticed their new promotion that starts today for their $aver's Card.
Beginning today, new accounts will receive 10 cents off per gallon of gas until April 30th 2011. After April 30th the discount lowers to 2 cents per gallon off.
This card is a lot like the Speed Pass that Exxon has, which is just an account that links to your checking account for direct debits. It itself is not a credit card or a store card. But for 10 cents off a gallon, that beats the Walmart/Sams club discount and worth the use in my opinion.
