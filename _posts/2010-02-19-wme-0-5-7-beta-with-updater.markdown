I've recompiled WME with x86 set instead of x64. I was running it 64 bit on my dev machine during some bouts of testing in .Net 4 and simply forgot to reset it.
This has been corrected and should now run correctly on all systems.
I've also uploaded the "Updater" and will show for any previous client using the correct updater. Worse case, simply uninstall and download the new copy. (It also includes Updater v1.0.2.1)
Remember if you want to convert to MP3, you will need to obtain the lame.exe and place it into the install directory.
