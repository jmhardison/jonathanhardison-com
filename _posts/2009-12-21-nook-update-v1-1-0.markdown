B&N has released an update for the nook, bringing the freshly released device to 1.1.0. Officially, it is not NOT a v1.0 device. So begins the rants and raves.
Anyways, the update actually seems to have greatly improved performance of the device from menu access to page turns. Although an actual 'update notes' has not been released by B&N yet, there is speculation of what it did do.
Some notable items are page turns speed, random crashing of books, time display, and the dreaded 'Formatting'.
