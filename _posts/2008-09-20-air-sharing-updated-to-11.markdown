The promising iPhone program Air Sharing has been updated to the highly anticipated version 1.1.

New features in this version are:

  * Greatly improved Windows Vista connectivity.

  * Support for mapping a driver letter in vista.

  * Fixed Bonjour when device name contains non-alphanumeric’s.

  * Viewing of RTF, RTFD, and TXT files with Unicode characters.

  * Better handling of network interruptions and aborted transfers.

  * More explicit connection details about different Wi-Fi issues.

  * Live-updating connection details when the network changes.

  * Support for viewing syntax-colored PHP scripts.

  * Fixed sleep prevention when Allow Sleep is off.

  * Fixed a crash when you press Done while a web or help page is loading.

  * Fixed a rare crash on launch.

  * Sundry bug fixes, performance enhancements and stability improvements.


On my Windows Mobile phone, I usually carry around documents and other items that I like to review while I’m traveling in the wonderful airport system. And seeing as how using a phone is easier than clunking out the laptop, this program makes it easy to load and view those items on the iPhone.
