<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.jonathanhardison.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2009&#47;10&#47;Capture7.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; margin-left: 0px; border-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Capture" border="0" alt="Capture" align="left" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.jonathanhardison.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2009&#47;10&#47;Capture_thumb1.png" width="414" height="368" &#47;><&#47;a> Though they say it is due to &ldquo;Customer Demand&rdquo;, we all know the real reason behind it is the Barnes and Noble nook.    <br &#47;>In response to the nook, Amazon has cut the price of their US&#47;International Kindle to $259 as well as combined the US and US&#47;International versions.    <br &#47;>    <br &#47;>What about those who already bought it? In the announcement from Amazon, they also say they will be issuing a $20 refund to those who purchased the US&#47;International version. But I wonder what will happen to those who bought the US only version? They now have one that is the same price as the US&#47;International version, and the same price as the nook. If I was one of those individuals, I would be livid knowing I just bought it and this happened. In fact, I would cancel my order or try to return it and just buy a nook. I mean that&rsquo;s what I would do, but you don&rsquo;t have to do that. And I don&rsquo;t either, since I already have a preordered nook.<&#47;p></p>
