<p>Apparently I'm so clumsy that I am capable of chopping the tip of my finger off.</p>

<p>All I wanted to do was chop an onion. Apparently the knife had other<br />
ideas and went down through my fingernail at an angle.</p>
<p>This is close to a week after the incident, but still healing.<br />
To save you more gore, I won't explain how I took care of it.</p>
