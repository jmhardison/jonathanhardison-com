On the 4th of February, Microsoft released the 64bit version of Windows Server 2008
 on MSDN. For those of us waiting on the x86 version, it is finally up as of February 6th.

The MSDN licensing model has been switched to the new VA 2.0/MAK, which
 will allow the key to activate a certain amount of times. Currently listed to be 1500 on our key.

For development purposes, that should last a very long time compared to the 15 activations
 previously.
