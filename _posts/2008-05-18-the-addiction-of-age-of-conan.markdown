<p>Sitting in a room in Topeka, I found myself here on the first day of early access without my system that has AoC installed.<br />
Oh whatever should I do? Unable to make sure I get my characters name on the server I want... But wait!? I have LOGMEIN on my desktop!</p>
<p>Patiently launching the game, I find that like clockwork there is yet another patch to download. On the edge of my seat I wait to see if<br />
the game will run remotely, or leave me hanging until I return. And what do I see? That's right, Age of Conan working inside a LogMeIn session!</p>
<p>Maneuvering the menu's, I make my wait to the island, where I promptly F10 and quit. No matter, as now I have my name, and that is all I wanted.</p>
<p>Of course I could have just waited until tomorrow afternoon when I will return home, but that would not fit my AoC addiction!</p>
