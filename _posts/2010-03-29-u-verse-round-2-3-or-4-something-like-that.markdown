<p>Ok, a recap of all that has been done.</p>
<p>1. Swap of modem.<br />
2. Removal of all devices except test system. (several used, including the att tough book. One at a time, hard wired.)<br />
3. Disable all unused ports, PNA, Wireless, USB, etc.<br />
4. Downgrade of service to 3mb plan to verify provisioning profile is updated. Confirmed worked.<br />
5. Upgrade of service back to 18mb plan. Confirmed worked, but speed still limited to 1-6mb.<br />
6. Line guys came out and recertified the fiber, it passed well under their allowed loss.</p>
<p>Line guys are leaving and will be back in the morning to replace the MUX on the side of the house. After that they are out of customer side equipment and everything else would be at the CO. He would be leaning on the ATM guys at that point as the fiber tests good.</p>
<p>Boy this be fun! :) At least the ATT guys are all nice professional guys. Feel bad cause they are all scrambling to catch up since ATT made the oh so nice mistake of advertising as an interview on the nightly news. That just blew their work load so high they will be at it for months before catching up.</p>
