<p>According to Apple Support, the 3G mini outlet has been recalled.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-27" title="165904-adapter-views2" src="http:&#47;&#47;jonathanhardison.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2008&#47;09&#47;165904-adapter-views2.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="175" &#47;></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Today Apple announced the Apple Ultracompact USB Power Adapter Exchange program. &nbsp;<br />
<&#47;em></p>
<p><em>Apple has determined that under certain conditions the new ultracompact Apple USB power adapter's metal prongs can break off and remain in a power outlet, creating a risk of electric shock. &nbsp;We have received reports of detached blades involving a very small percentage of the adapters sold, but no injuries have been reported.<&#47;em><&#47;blockquote><br />
I have yet to be able to access the online form for submitting the claim, but I'm sure it's because of how soon this was posted.</p>
<p>Read the full details <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.apple.com&#47;support&#47;usbadapter&#47;exchangeprogram&#47;" target="_blank">here<&#47;a>.</p>
