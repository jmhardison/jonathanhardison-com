<p>Short and sweet here.</p>
<p>1. MUX replaced. Issue remains.<br />
2. Tested with RG plugged direct to the MUX by taking it outside. Issue remains. Officially no other items at customer location to test or rule out. Everything has been replaced or removed from equation.</p>
<p>Now the good part. What is the one thing that ATT cannot see with their uvers management system (CMS or whatever). The Springfield MO CO, specifically the group I will not so lovingly refer to as ASI.</p>
<p>I have found out that another user in Republic Missouri is having a speed issue where they get roughly 5 meg on an 18 meg package. And the common point of failure is ... ASI.</p>
<p>Now I wait to see who will beat some big sticks across their head.</p>
<p>Put simply, the tech's that have come out have done everything in their knowledge to do and have been very nice and professional. But in the end, my harping is getting heard. I have been asking all parties, what is between myself and ATT that can still effect provisioning speeds. Everyone wanted to say nothing, until I walked through the connection with them.</p>
<p>Where does the video service feed from since it is always a separate feed in IPTV from the Internet feed. Answer Kansas City Missouri. Ok, so what feeds the Internet? And the path to the light apparently shines now.</p>
<p>Update after I throw some rocks.</p>
<p>*UPDATE*</p>
<p>So the premis guy just left, shaking his head. They basically went back through everything, and I've explained that we've done everything possible to replace or remove the customer side from the equation. And he admited that he didn't think there was a single thing he could do but tell level 2 what he saw. Which he did.</p>
<p>So level 2 opened a case with UPak, or something like that. But all of us that have been on this side of the problem see it as a problem in the CO. Whereas the uverse tier 2 people think it is customer side issues. "You must be running a torrent" or "changing the internal IP of the router to a non default ip will cause this." Yea ok, reset to defaults and let the ATT guy plug himself in by himself. Same issue? Yea, must be running a torrent on the ATT laptops then. Grrrr.</p>
<p>Anyways, I'm waiting now for a call from these guys. Hoping someone somewhere will actually take ownership of the problem and start looking at things outside of the box and NOT on the script. I don't know how many people they will send to my house before the stop looking here. :)</p>
