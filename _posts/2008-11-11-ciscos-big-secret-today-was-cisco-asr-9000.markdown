Cisco unveiled today through their latest teaser advertising, something they had already teased with the series 1000. But today it actually is for the latest model, the ASR 9000.

  > Cisco ASR 9000 Series in all it's glory. Has a strange 'retro futuristic' look to it, like something out of 2001: A Space Odyssey.


The new Cisco ASR 9000 Series routers will change the face of what we expect a router to be capable of. With a purpose developed processor that brings a lot of the functions of a router and firewall on chip, at blistering speeds. For those who do not already know, ASR (Aggregation Services Router) is the evolution of both an ISR (Integrated Services Router) and a Firewall. It is what cisco is driving for in the edge and provider networks.

From the email:

  >  Mobile broadband traffic will increase more than 20 fold in the next 4 years.
  >  By 2012, half of all content crossing the Internet will be video.
  >  And there are more than 3 billion people out there who are still waiting
  >  to download their first song and watch their first online video.
  >
  > The future is here. So is the machine.
  >  Meet the ASR 9000 Series Routers.
  >  Beautifully engineered for whatever may lie ahead.
  >
  > The industry standard is about to go up.
