So in case you missed the news the other day, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS has been released to the world. Some of the yummies that are immediately visible is the fact that it has gone pretty!

Other than a horde of new features, and some drastic design changes, this version feels more usable by the masses simply due to the visual changes. Because lets face it, the majority of computer users want something elegant and flowing that they are drawn to, not something clunky and ugly.

Even installing additional software that used to be in an eye draining list, is now glorified with melded information pages and install status.    ![img]({{site.base}}/imagecontent/2010/04/Capture21.png)
