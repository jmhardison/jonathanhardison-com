Apple released iTunes 9.0.3.15 the other day, and sure fire here is the follow up. It isn't the new version we all are waiting on, but it is a nice fix. 3.1.3 of iPhone OS has been released, and it addresses at least one item that I've been dealing with. The random close on open issue of some applications. That is where the app starts and immediately closes.
