Issues surrounding the support of Google products has been known to carry poor tech support. More specifically, if you have a problem they want you to either email or post a comment on a forum. You can have phone support if you are a premiere user, however they ask you to send an email and they will get back to you.

So if this is their idea of support, especially when they want to take over business and introduce an OS, just how do they expect to keep people happy when to them "The customer is dumb and never right" or "Speaking with customers is a last resort."

Now don't get me wrong, I do use Google Apps. But I watched someone close to me deal with them, and combined with my beginning problems even starting with Google Apps... I can only hope they wake up and start caring more about their customers directly, being more responsive, and understanding that you must be able to get someone on the phone as that is what makes large customers to the single user feel good.
