While sitting in the boarding area I see the total encompass of the need in my life for coffee. If it were not for starbucks I would be sleeping across from my gate.... And miss my flight. Which in turn would cause the end of all things as I myself lay sleeping a deep uninterrupted sleep.

Ok not really, but they sure are trying to take over the world.
