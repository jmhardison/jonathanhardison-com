<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-46" title="ie8blog2" src="http:&#47;&#47;jonathanhardison.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2008&#47;09&#47;ie8blog2.png" alt="" width="204" height="79" &#47;>Following up on the release of IE 8 beta 1, comes IE 8 beta 2. Maybe this will actually get released soon as a final product. Wouldn't it be nice? A version of IE that actually works according to standards?</p>
<p>Well, I am actually just excited that the browser is finally taking a leap forward to meet and exceed the abilities of third party browsers such as Safari, FireFox, Opera and the Chrome beta. Time will tell though, for now keep an eye on the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.msdn.com&#47;ie&#47;" target="_blank">IE 8 blog<&#47;a>, as there is a lot of cool information over there. (Check out the search recommendations!)</p>
