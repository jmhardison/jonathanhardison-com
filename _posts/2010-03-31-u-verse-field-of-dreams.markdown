<p>Yesterday evening I got a call that they had located the issue in the Springfield CO, in particular on the VRAD my gateway ties into. Apparently this known issue involved a reboot of that VRAD which could not be performed until their maintenance window between midnight and 4am.<br />
But, now that it is complete, my speeds are where they should be and it is great!</p>

<p>Sounds like someone failed to do a firmware upgrade before U-Verse service was turned up. But hey, that's ok I'm sure they've been overly busy since someone had the bright idea of advertising in the form of an interview on the nightly news.</p>
