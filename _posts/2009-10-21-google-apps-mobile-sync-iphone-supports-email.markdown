<p>I didn&rsquo;t even notice this one happen, and only caught it because I was floating around the Google Apps Administration site. Apparently Google has updated the mobile sync to support not only calendar and contacts as it has been for a while, but also email. This was a big hurdle for a while as you would need one sync setup using exchange active sync, and another IMAP setup for your email. The email would not always come to your phone on time and you would have to manually update it.<&#47;p>
<p>&#160;<&#47;p>
<p>Well that is no longer the case, as you can now run all services through the one sync setup. Another note is they have enabled you to modify your calendar sync, follow these directions from your iPhone.<&#47;p>
<p>Google Sync allows you to choose up to 25 Calendars with the Calendar app on your iPhone (on iPhone OS 3.0) <&#47;p>
<p>To select which calendars to sync to your iPhone, follow the steps below:<&#47;p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Safari browser on your phone and go to http:&#47;&#47;m.google.com&#47;sync. <&#47;li>
<li>Sign in with your account and select your phone from the list of devices you've set up for Google Sync. <&#47;li>
<li>Bookmark this page so you can return to it easily.<&#47;li> <&#47;ol>
<p>Google Apps alternate instructions:<&#47;p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Safari browser on your phone and go to http:&#47;&#47;m.google.com <&#47;li>
<li>Click on <strong>Google Apps user?<&#47;strong> at the bottom of the screen. <&#47;li>
<li>Enter your domain name (e.g., YourDomain.com). <&#47;li>
<li>Click the <strong>Sync<&#47;strong> icon in your domain area (this section has a green background). <&#47;li>
<li>Sign in if required. <&#47;li>
<li>Select your device to configure Calendars.<&#47;li> <&#47;ol></p>
