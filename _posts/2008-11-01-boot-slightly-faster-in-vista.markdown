<p>So I saw this tip floating around and thought I would post it on here.</p>
<p>Vista by default only uses a single processor&#47;core during boot. If you have a system with multiple processors&#47;cores, you can follow this trick to enable them during boot. They are still used when the system is up and running, it is just during the boot up that a single processor&#47;core is used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First open up msconfig.</p>
<p>Then follow this screen shot and set the number to how many cores&#47;processors you have.</p>
<p>Processors and cores are interchangeable in this utility. If you have one processor with two cores, pick two. If you have two processors with one core, pick two. If you have two quad core processors, pick 8. It will only show you what your system has so you are safe to pick the max listed.</p>
