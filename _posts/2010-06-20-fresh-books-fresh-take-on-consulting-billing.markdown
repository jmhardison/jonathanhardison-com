<p>So I have signed up for the free subscription to Fresh Books, a site for in the cloud billing and time tracking.</p>
<p>What I have seen so far has impressed me. The site is very clean, well organized, and highly intuitive. The billing&#47;invoicing functions are down right awesome, and the fact that the client can sign in and view their outstanding invoices and make payments is just excellent!</p>
<p>I would highly suggest if you are in the market for a site to do invoicing, time tracking, support cases, or more... to give Fresh Books a try!</p>
