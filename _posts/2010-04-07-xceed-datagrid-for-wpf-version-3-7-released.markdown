Wow, this one came out of nowhere.
Xceed DataGrid for WPF has been updated to version 3.7. Here is a quick snapshot of the changes.
What's new in Xceed DataGrid for WPF Professional Edition v3.7:

  * A new continuous insertion mode property lets programmers deliver improved data entry to end-users, removing the need to manually go to the first editable cell after entering a row's data.

  * New events give programmers control over how the data grid reacts when the current visual row is changing or has changed, and allows the change to be cancelled in certain situations.

  * Column cells can now be non-focusable when read-only.

  * Notifications for auto-filter value changes are now provided.

  * Unicode is now enabled in the grid's clipboard exporters for enhanced character support.

  * Several bug fixes.<br />
