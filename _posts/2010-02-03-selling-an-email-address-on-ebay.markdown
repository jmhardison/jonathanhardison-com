Seriously, this is taking it a bit too far. Someone has gone and registered a Hotmail account, just to turn around and sell it on eBay.
I find it amusing that anyone would really even bid on this, you business does not gain reputation by having your email address at Hotmail.
But none the less people have bid on it, and it looks to sell. Now proceeding with the face plant.
