<p>Seriously, this is taking it a bit too far. Someone has gone and registered a Hotmail account, just to turn around and sell it on eBay.</p>
<p>I find it amusing that anyone would really even bid on this, you business does not gain reputation by having your email address at Hotmail.</p>
<p>But none the less people have bid on it, and it looks to sell. Now proceeding with the face plant.</p>
