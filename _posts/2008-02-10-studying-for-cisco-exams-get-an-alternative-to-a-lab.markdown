I’ve had this software for a few years now, ever since a coworker referred me to it.

[Dynamips](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=160317){:target="blank"} is a Cisco router emulator written by Christophe Fillot. It emulates 1700, 2600, 3600, 3700, and 7200 hardware platforms, and runs standard IOS images.

If you are ever in the position that you need a lab of Cisco equipment, and just can’t
 seem to afford the large cash lump to put into it, then this software is for you! With
 Dynamips/Dynagen, you are not just simulating the system… You actually are emulating
 the hardware and running the full blow Cisco IOS inside of it.
 This give you the great ability to actually complete all aspects of a lab except for “physical”
 items.

And if for some reason you are a little frisky, you can also use this software to run your own
 router on a spare computer as it can bind interfaces in the emulated router to physical interfaces
 in your computer.
 In addition to the software above, if you are on Windows you will need to download and install
 the latest [WinPcap](http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.wiretapped.net/pub/security/packet-capture/winpcap/install/default.htm){:target="_blank"} software. (You only need winpcap.dll and packet.dll, but it is just easier to get the whole package.)
