<p>I've had this software for a few years now, ever since a coworker referred me to it.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;sourceforge.net&#47;project&#47;showfiles.php?group_id=160317"><em>Dynamips<&#47;em><&#47;a><em> is a Cisco router emulator written by Christophe Fillot. It emulates 1700, 2600,<br />
3600, 3700, and 7200 hardware platforms, and runs standard IOS images.<&#47;em></p>
<p>If you are ever in the position that you need a lab of Cisco equipment, and just can't<br />
seem to afford the large cash lump to put into it, then this software is for you! With<br />
Dynamips&#47;Dynagen, you are not just simulating the system... You actually are emulating<br />
the hardware and running the full blow Cisco IOS inside of it.<br />
This give you the great ability to actually complete all aspects of a lab except for "physical"<br />
items.</p>
<p>And if for some reason you are a little frisky, you can also use this software to run your own<br />
router on a spare computer as it can bind interfaces in the emulated router to physical interfaces<br />
in your computer.<br />
In addition to the software above, if you are on Windows you will need to download and install<br />
the latest <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mirrorservice.org&#47;sites&#47;ftp.wiretapped.net&#47;pub&#47;security&#47;packet-capture&#47;winpcap&#47;install&#47;default.htm">WinPcap<&#47;a> software. (You only need winpcap.dll and packet.dll, but it is just easier to<br />
get the whole package.)</p>
