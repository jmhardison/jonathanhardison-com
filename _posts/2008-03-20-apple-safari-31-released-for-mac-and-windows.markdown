So this is new, apple did a turn about and has released another of their coveted products on the windows platform. Safari, Apple’s high speed ultra sleek(ish) web browser, hits windows with a thundering bolt of lamb cries. Boasting 1.9 times faster web experience than IE 7, you too can enjoy the murkey greyness of that which is [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari){:target="_blank"}

I am happy to see Apple do this, as it shows a good faith on their part to try and embrace Windows users as they are. As switching to a Mac is less than appealing to me, nothing wrong with it, it just isn’t for me. (And that is coming from someone who is running Mac OS 10.4 on a system.)

Just in case you are curious, here is my preference of systems:

1. Windows
 2. Linux (Preferably Ubuntu or Kubuntu)
 3. Solaris
 4. Mac OS
 5. Zeta OS (Formerly BeOS)
