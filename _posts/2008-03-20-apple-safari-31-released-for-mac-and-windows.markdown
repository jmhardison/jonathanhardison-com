<p>So this is new, apple did a turn about and has released another of their coveted products on the windows platform.<br />
Safari, Apple's high speed ultra sleek(ish) web browser, hits windows with a thundering bolt of lamb cries.<br />
Boasting 1.9 times faster web experience than IE 7, you too can enjoy the murkey greyness of that which is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.apple.com&#47;safari&#47;">Safari<&#47;a>.<br />

<p>I am happy to see Apple do this, as it shows a good faith on their part to try and embrace Windows users as they are.<br />
As switching to a Mac is less than appealing to me, nothing wrong with it, it just isn't for me. (And that is coming from<br />
someone who is running Mac OS 10.4 on a system.)</p>
<p>Just in case you are curious, here is my preference of systems:</p>
<p>1. Windows<br />
2. Linux (Preferably Ubuntu or Kubuntu)<br />
3. Solaris<br />
4. Mac OS<br />
5. Zeta OS (Formerly BeOS)</p>
