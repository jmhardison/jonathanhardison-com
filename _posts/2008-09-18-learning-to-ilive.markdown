So after getting an iphone recently, I am learning to live mobileâ€¦ Again.

Having moved from a windows mobile powered htc touch, it is quite an amazing change. This device has so many possibilities that it is just plain amazing. So amazing that I have re-deployed my blog as a wordpress site just to use the worspress mobile application.

Now the thing is not perfect, and it has some drastic shortcomings. But since I still have a sprint treo 800w, you are sure to have some comparisons.

For now just enjoy the thought that I wrote this entry while relaxed in my bed watching adult swim.
