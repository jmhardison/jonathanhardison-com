The rumor mill was right on the money! Apple releases the iPhone 2.2 update today. With this version comes some nice new features for all of us iPhone Monkey’s to enjoy.

From the update site:

  > What’s in this update:
  > Enhancements to Maps
  > Google Street View
  > Public transit and walking directions
  > Display address of dropped pins
  > Share location via email
  > *Decrease in call setup failures and dropped calls*
  > Enhancements to Mail
  > Resolved isolated issues with scheduled fetching of email
  > Improved formatting of wide HTML email
  > Podcasts are now available for download in iTunes application (over Wi-Fi and cellular network)
  > Improved stability and performance of Safari
  > Improved sound quality of Visual Voicemail messages
  > Pressing Home button from any Home screen displays the first Home screen
  > Preference to turn on/off auto-correction in Keyboard Settings


You might have noticed I have bolded the line about decreasing call setup failures. I for one have been bothered by this issue for a while. Where I hang up a call and try to make another call only to receive the “Call Failed” message, and then have to reboot the phone to work again.

Here’s hoping the stability has improved dramatically!
