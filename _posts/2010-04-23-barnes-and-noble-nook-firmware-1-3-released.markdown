So after a long delay between updates, B&N has released the latest firmware update for their nook eReader.
Version 1.3 notes are as follows, but the most interesting happens to be that there is a beta web browser now. Interesting!
<blockquote>Our new software update has exciting new features and improves NOOK's overall performance. Included in Version 1.3:

  * The breakthrough Read In Store experience, now in beta, which allows you to read complete eBooks in Barnes & Noble stores.
  * Sudoku and Chess
  * Wi-Fi connectivity in more hotspots and a beta basic Web browser. Plus, additional reading and performance improvements, such as faster page turns and an enhanced home screen.<br />

The software update is via manual download, [here](http://images.barnesandnoble.com/presources/download/nook/v1.3.0/signed_bravo_update.dat){:target="_blank"}

or, for NOOKs connected to Wi-Fi&reg;, via automatic download over the next week. (Note: This update will not be distributed via the 3G network.) For an automatic Wi-Fi&reg; update, you may need to 'Check for new B&N content' via the My Library area in order to initiate the update.
