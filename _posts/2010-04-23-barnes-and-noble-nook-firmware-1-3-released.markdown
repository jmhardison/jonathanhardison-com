<p>So after a long delay between updates, B&amp;N has released the latest firmware update for their nook eReader.</p>
<p>Version 1.3 notes are as follows, but the most interesting happens to be that there is a beta web browser now. Interesting!</p>
<blockquote><p>Our new software update has exciting new features and improves NOOK's overall performance. Included in Version 1.3:</p>
<ol>
<li>The breakthrough Read In Store experience, now in beta, which allows you to read complete eBooks in Barnes &amp; Noble stores.<&#47;li>
<li>Sudoku and Chess<&#47;li>
<li>Wi-Fi&reg; connectivity in more hotspots and a beta basic Web browser. Plus, additional reading and performance improvements, such as faster page turns and an enhanced home screen.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol><br />
The software update is via manual download,&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;images.barnesandnoble.com&#47;presources&#47;download&#47;nook&#47;v1.3.0&#47;signed_bravo_update.dat">available here<&#47;a> or, for NOOKs connected to Wi-Fi&reg;, via automatic download over the next week. (Note: This update will not be distributed via the 3G network.) For an automatic Wi-Fi&reg; update, you may need to 'Check for new B&amp;N content' via the My Library area in order to initiate the update.</p>
