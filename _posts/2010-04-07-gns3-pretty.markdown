So I've been using Dynamips for a while, and even recommended it before here for those looking for a cheap way to build their Cisco training lab. (Cheap as in free!) Well I just recently stumbled upon GNS3 which provides a very nice graphical front end to it. I guess that is what happens when you actually read the dynamips page for a change instead of just downloading!

Anyways, this provides a very graphical way of managing the experience, including a Visio style display of your connections and setup.

Check it out! [gns3](http://www.gns3.net){:target="_blank"}
