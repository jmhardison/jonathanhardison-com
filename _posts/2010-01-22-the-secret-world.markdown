Looks like things are firing up. Two important dates for TSW that have been found through the latest viral clues...
1. February 16th, 6:30pm - 8:00pm. (No specification of time zone, though I would guess it would be eastern to match the town.)
2. April 3rd. [Link](http://www.kingsmouth.com){:target="_blank"}
