The recall site is now live for people to submit their claims online.

This is great for me since I don’t live close to an Apple Store, and I really don’t like visiting AT&T for this.

Those with the 3G should be making those claims now at the [support page](https://supportform.apple.com/200809/){:target="_blank"}
