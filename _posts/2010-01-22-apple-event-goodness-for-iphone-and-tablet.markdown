<p>The Apple event is coming up in a few days... and rumor mills are hard at work.</p>
<p>Items I find interesting....</p>
<p>1. iPhone OS 4.0: Supports 3G and 3GS. Will have a revamped UI and more multitasking support.</p>
<p>2. Apple Tablet... rumor has it it resembles an iPhone 1, smashed by a rolling pin.</p>
