<p>If you are like me you probably love the smartcover, but also want something to carry the device in for added protection. For instance taking it to work and having a little more padding as you get it there since the smartcover only protects the screen.</p>
<p>Well good news for everyone who wants this!!! BoxWave has a case, the&nbsp;Elite Leather Apple iPad 2 Messenger Pouch, can handle your iPad 2 with the SmartCover still attached. I received confirmation today from BoxWave presales support in regards to this topic:</p>
