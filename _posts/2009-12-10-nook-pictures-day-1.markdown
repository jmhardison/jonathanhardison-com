Skipping the unboxing event here, as everyone has seen those video's by now.
Moving ahead to the file copy, size comparison and PDF displays.

The nook when compared to the brochure you can obtain from B&N is almost spot on. The sizes are just a tiny bit different, but you get the idea when shown next to an iPhone 3G.

The nook switches to one of its states, this one known as USB Drive Mode, when plugged into a computer.

The copy progress to the nook is a bit slow as you can see in this screen cap. I am copying 1.26GB of files to the nook internal storage, which the usable space of the storage is actually less than 1.27GB. I had it connected to a USB2.0 port, but the speed was still quite slow. Though, in reality how often will I be doing this?

The nook displaying the cover page of a PDF pulled from the Training Kit for 70-432 disc.

Lesson from same PDF displayed in Medium size.

Same page displayed in Small size, this size tries to keep the original formatting and zooms out the page to fit on screen.
