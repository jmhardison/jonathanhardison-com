It took a few emails to customer support, but my ZAGG has finally arrived for my 3G iPhone.

Originally, I ordered just the back of the product since I have a screen protector on right now. After waiting two weeks, I emailed support to find out the product had been delayed for some reason. After requesting to cancel the order, they upgraded my order to UPS shipping and I received the product a week later.

After getting the item, and reading through the very complex steps… all 6 of them. Ok maybe not complex, since I know how to peel a sticker and put it on a surface. But for safety sake, I treated the instructions like I have never seen them before. If you have ever worked with vinyl before, such as window decals, the process is basically the same.

You have a sticker, that you must wet down with an applicator to deactivate the “sticky” long enough to position the item. That is all well and good, but something this small with a few delicate corners makes it a bit more frustrating. The large back is easy to place, but the wings that go around the side of the iPhone are a bit more troubling. Once you squeegee out the back, the sides you must use your palm to press them out. And if that doesn’t work, grab a hair dryer on low to dry the wings off a bit so they stick better.

If you play your cards right and don’t rush yourself, you will actually get the piece installed and all the corners line up correctly. Don’t worry about being quick, as that is what the applicator is for. You can move the sticker around all you want until you start to squeegee out the liquid.



The first thing I have noticed about the product though is the texture. It does provide for extra grip like the company advertises, however thinking about it on the front of the device makes me wonder what the finger operation would feel like after continued use. Not that it wouldn’t work, but there is just a little more friction from it than I like. And continued front screen use, would probably result in a slight uncomfortable feeling in the finger tip.

There is also a slight smell to the product after it is on the device. Basically, think of the old floaties or rafts you take to pools. It has that “plastic” smell to it. But that is nothing, as most people don’t consistently have the iPhone jabbed up their nostriles. I just have a weird thing of smelling new technology… the vibrant technical goodness can be obsorbed that way. Trust me, I know these things!



Here is a picture of the iPhone once applied. Notice the edges, that’s about all you see of it. It is not a complete cover like I thought it would be, but enough that 99.9% of your device will be protected.
