So after finishing the installation of Team Foundation Server into my VM managing my source control, and deploying VS2010 and the TFS Explorer on my two development systems... I have migrated my WME application for SourceGear's Vault into TFS2010 and have began the creation of the new WPF version of the application.
My first impressions with the RTM build of VS2010 is that it is extremely stable, and the XML editor/designer speed has increased dramatically. Just building the basic outlay of the application has produced zero hickups. Which is surprising including the fact that I have applied a custom theme with merged resource dictionaries.

Of course everything else in the product also feels faster and more stable. Personally I am happy to put my source control back into TFS, I had not used it in a long time since I removed my spare server from the network that was running it. Of course, Vault wasn't bad, but it just was not as embedded as I wanted it to be. TFS 2010 by far is the easiest setup of the many permutations of TFS that I've done in a long time. To put it simply, it just works!
More after I have a chance to digest!
