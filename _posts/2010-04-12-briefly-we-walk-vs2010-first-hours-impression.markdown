<p>So after finishing the installation of Team Foundation Server into my VM managing my source control, and deploying VS2010 and the TFS Explorer on my two development systems... I have migrated my WME application for SourceGear's Vault into TFS2010 and have began the creation of the new WPF version of the application.</p>
<p>My first impressions with the RTM build of VS2010 is that it is extremely stable, and the XML editor&#47;designer speed has increased dramatically. Just building the basic outlay of the application has produced zero hickups. Which is surprising including the fact that I have applied a custom theme with merged resource dictionaries.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.jonathanhardison.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2010&#47;04&#47;Capture1.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-444" style="border: 0px initial initial;" title="Capture" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.jonathanhardison.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2010&#47;04&#47;Capture1-300x239.png" alt="" width="300" height="239" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>Of course everything else in the product also feels faster and more stable. Personally I am happy to put my source control back into TFS, I had not used it in a long time since I removed my spare server from the network that was running it. Of course, Vault wasn't bad, but it just was not as embedded as I wanted it to be. TFS 2010 by far is the easiest setup of the many permutations of TFS that I've done in a long time. To put it simply, it just works!</p>
<p>More after I have a chance to digest!</p>
