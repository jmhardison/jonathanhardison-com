# JonathanHardison.com

*This repository holds the migration copy of my personal website.*

This repository is for the JonathanHardison.com site in jekyllrb, being converted from Wordpress.

## Works In Progress

Items that are being actively worked on:

  * Correct all posts that were imported, removing all HTML markup and converting to markdown.
  * Integration with CI platforms and autodeployment to hosting platform.
  * Review and archival of un-needed posts.
  * Review and setup of alternative download mechanism for binaries hosted on site. (Keeping out of GitHub for now?)
