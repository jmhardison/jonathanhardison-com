After a while of running on github pages, which honestly still work fine... I got the wild itch to go and change things up again. I'm taking some classes on Udemy and see myself getting to the point that I want more functionality than I can get through github pages. So, enter Heroku.

It's been a while since I looked at this service, and it's come a long way. Definitely something I'll keep in mind for future projects.

As it is now, my site code is stored in GitHub, but is linked to a heroku pipeline in combination with Travis-ci. Travis-ci is responsible for build testing, and heroku is responsible for pull previews, staging and release to production. (Sprinkle in some testing with snyk and codacy.)

I'll try to take some time and write up what I've done, but this was a simple migration and when behind CloudFlare, I still fit into the free buckets of Heroku. Nice!
