I registered for the free Xceed DataGrid for WPF. There's only 25 days left to do it. [link](http://xceed.com/freegrid">http://xceed.com/freegrid){:target="_blank"}

Xceed DataGrid is an awesome grid component for WPF. I've tinkered with it for a while and love it. In fact it is in use in one of my projects called DCTracker.

Hurry and be a good developer... or crazy pack rat and go register!
