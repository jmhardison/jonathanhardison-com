According to Apple Support, the 3G mini outlet has been recalled.

  > Today Apple announced the Apple Ultracompact USB Power Adapter Exchange program.  
  > Apple has determined that under certain conditions the new ultracompact Apple USB power adapter’s metal prongs can break off and remain in a power outlet, creating a risk of electric shock.  We have received reports of detached blades involving a very small percentage of the adapters sold, but no injuries have been reported.
  

I have yet to be able to access the online form for submitting the claim, but I’m sure it’s because of how soon this was posted.
