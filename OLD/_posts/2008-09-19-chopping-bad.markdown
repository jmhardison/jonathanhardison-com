Apparently I’m so clumsy that I am capable of chopping the tip of my finger off.

All I wanted to do was chop an onion. Apparently the knife had other ideas and went down through my fingernail at an angle.

This is close to a week after the incident, but still healing. To save you more gore, I won’t explain how I took care of it.
