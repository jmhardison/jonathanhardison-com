Everyone join the band that has access, and together we can bring down the Interweb!

Ok, so Microsoft has released the latest version of Windows on MSDN for the world to have... Windows 7.

The long awaited OS has finally arrived for us true believers.... scratch that... for us nerds!

Those that have MSDN access, go get it!
Those that have a valid software assurance agreement, you gets to wait until tomorrow.
Everyone else? See you October 22nd at your local best buy!
