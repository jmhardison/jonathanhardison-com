Sitting in a room in Topeka, I found myself here on the first day of early access without my system that has AoC installed. Oh whatever should I do? Unable to make sure I get my characters name on the server I want… But wait!? I have LOGMEIN on my desktop!

Patiently launching the game, I find that like clockwork there is yet another patch to download. On the edge of my seat I wait to see if the game will run remotely, or leave me hanging until I return. And what do I see? That’s right, Age of Conan working inside a LogMeIn session!

Maneuvering the menu’s, I make my wait to the island, where I promptly F10 and quit. No matter, as now I have my name, and that is all I wanted.

Of course I could have just waited until tomorrow afternoon when I will return home, but that would not fit my AoC addiction!
